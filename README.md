The official website repository of [BTCPay Server project](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver/).

BTCPayServer is an open-source, self-hosted payment processor for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

The API is supposed to be compatible to BitPay so merchants will only
need to change the API url to be able to continue processing bitcoins.
