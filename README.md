BTCPay Server is a project by @NicolasDorier, aiming to provide a
checkout experience comparable to BitPay (since they are planning to
discontinue support for bitcoin and switch to btc1).

The API is supposed to be compatible to BitPay so merchants will only
need to change the API url to be able to continue processing bitcoins.

A slack channel is available at https://forkbitpay.slack.com/ - get your
